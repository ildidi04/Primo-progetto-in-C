# Primo-progetto-in-C
This is my first ever project in C but generally in coding world.
It's a simple game I made to increase my programming exam's grade in university, there are no  animation or aesthetics but it should work, at least i think...
Let me know if you find any bugs or if there are any improvements I can make.
All the instructions are given so I won't waste time explaining here and sorry if you don't speak italian but most code and comments i wrote are in italian, only users interface is in english, so i hope you'll understand the functions anyway. Enjoy!
