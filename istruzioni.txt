WELCOME TO KILL ALL ENEMIES!
The goal of this simple game, as you can assume from the title, is killing ALL the enemies; to do that you have make a path that points above the enemy.
Be Careful to the warnings that will eventually appear because, if you want to fight an enemy and you are close to others, you have to face everyone. 
Every time you move your player loses 1 point of life.
You can find 2 types of boosters hidden in the map to help you win the match:
-Cure booster to increase your life's points;
-Weapon's booster to increase your weapon's power;
There are 2 types of weapons and you can have only one at time: a sword or a knife; the knife is weaker, so it's advised to look for a sword.
If you kill an enemy you can go over his cell and type any substitution commands to switch your weapon with the enemy's one.
Choose a mode from 1 to 3, type 1 for easy, 2 for medium and 3 for hard; once you have chosen the mode press the key enter and type your name 
that will be also your player's name. 
IMPORTANT NOTES: 
-if you dont remember all the controls while you are playing  type l or L(standing for Legend).
-Press key enter/send after each control/command you do.
ENJOY!
