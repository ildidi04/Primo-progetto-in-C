WELCOME TO KILL ALL ENEMIES!
The goal of this simple game as you can assume from the title is killing all the enemies, you win each mode after you killed all the enemies; 
to do that you have make a path that points above the enemy. Be Careful to the warnings that will eventually appear because if you want to fight 
an enemy and you are close to other you have to face everyone.
For this reasons to help you make it there are scattered throughout the map hidden heals/medications and weapon boosters/enhancers that will
increase your chances of winning each fight with an enemy.
If you kill the enemy you can type the command "sub" and if you are over the enemy's cell you can switch your weapon with the enemy's one.
Choose a mode from 1 to 3, type 1 for easy, 2 for medium and 3 for hard; once you have chosen the mode press the key enter and type your name 
that will be also your player's name. 
IMPORTANT NOTES: 
-if you dont remember all the controls while you are playing  type l or L(standing for Legend).
-Press key enter/send after each control/command you do.
ENJOY!
